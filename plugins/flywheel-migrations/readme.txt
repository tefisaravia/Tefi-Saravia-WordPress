== FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

=Can I still use this plugin if I don’t have a Flywheel account?=
No, but creating a Flywheel account is simple (and free)! [Create an account](app.getflywheel.com).

=What information will the plugin ask for?=
You’ll need to provide your email address, Flywheel dashboard URL, Flywheel temporary URL, and Flywheel privacy mode credentials.  Please visit the migration page in your site dashboard to find this information, and check out this [migration help doc](https://getflywheel.com/wordpress-support/migrating-your-site-from-another-host-to-flywheel/) for more details.

=Is Multisite Network supported with this plugin?=
Yes, this plugin has been developed to be capable of moving full Multisite Networks! To move a full network, make sure to activate the plugin.

=Can I migrate a site into or out of a Multisite Network using this plugin?=
No. This plugin is designed to migrate only a single WordPress install as is. This plugin does not support single WordPress installs being migrated into Multisite Networks. It also does not support migrating a sub-site out of a Multisite Network.

=How long does it take to migrate a website?=
Sites come in all shapes and sizes. Because of this, migrations can range anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours.

=What happens if I run into an error after the migration is complete?=
No matter what happens, we’re always here to help! Once your migration is complete, we suggest clicking through your site for quality assurance. If anything is amiss, reach out to our [technical onboarding team](https://www.getflywheel.com/migration).

=Other than running the plugin, is there anything else I need to do?=
Once the migration completes, you will still need to [take your site live](https://www.getflywheel.com/migration) by updating your DNS to point to our servers. If you have any custom configurations on your current server, our [support team](https://www.getflywheel.com/migration) can assist you in setting those up on your Flywheel server.

=Do I need to leave the window open while the migration is processing?=
Nope! Sit back and relax while robots move your site. Once your migration is complete, we’ll send a completion email to your inbox.
